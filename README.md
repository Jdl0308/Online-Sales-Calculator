# Online-Sales-Calculator
Want to know the potential payout for the item you list online whiteout having to do the calculation by hand? This program does that and supports Depop, Ebay, and Grailed for now.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my program! This is the first one I created just for fun. As someone who frequently sells items online, I got tired of calculating my payouts manually, so I made this tool to simplify things.

Important Notes:

Please follow the instructions carefully. If the input is incorrect, the program might close or an error could occur. I'll be working on improving this to ensure input errors are handled more smoothly.

The program accounts for decimals up to the hundredths place. For example: If you enter 12.345, the program will process it as 12.34, rounding up to the nearest hundredth.
